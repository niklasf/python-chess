3. Nc3 Nf6
4. Bg5 {It was Pillsbury who first demonstrated the
strength of the this move, which today is routine} 
4..Be7
5. Nf3 Nd7
6. Rc1 O-O
7. e3 b6 {In order to develop the Queen Bishop on
Bb7. This was the most popular way of defending the
Queen's gambit declined at the time.}
8. cxd5 {Depriving Black of the opportunity to play
dxc4 when the diagonal b7-g2 would be open for his
Queen Bishop.} 8...exd5 ({The classical
continuation more common today is} 8..Nf6xd5 {which 
accomplishes some exchanging after} 9. Bxe7, Qxe7 10.
Nxd5, e6xd5)
9. Bd3 Bb7
10. O-O c5 {A strategical necessity. Otherwise, this
pawn will remain backward and vulnerable to White's
Rook on the half open Queen Bishop file.}
11. Re1 {Whatever the purpose of this move, it turns
out to be a loss of time, for the Rook later goes
back to f1.} 
11...c4 {This move releases the
tension in the center in order to commence a queen
side attack. White will counter this by an attack on
the other wing.}
12. Bb1 a6 {In order to play b5. Black's plan is to
advance his queen side pawns with the ultimate aim of
obtaining a passed pawn.}
13. Ne5 {The knight is here aggressively posted in the
neighborhood of Black's King.} 13...b5
14. f4 {This move furthers White's attack in several
ways.  Should Black ever play Nxe5, White will
recapture with the Bishop Pawn and open his King
Bishop file. The White's King Bishop Pawn may later
in the game advance to f5, threatening to break up
Black's kingside by f6. White's King Rook now can
advance to Black's kingside by Rf1-Rf3 and Rg3 or
Rh3.} 14...Re8 {To be able to bring his Queen Knight
to Nf8, where it is an excellent defensive piece.}
15. Qf3 {Bringing the Queen to the attack.} 15...Nf8
16. Ne2 {Transferring the Knight to the kingside.}
16...Ne4 $1 {Black blocks the White King Bishop
diagonal and exchanges off his King Bishop. Each 
exchange favors Black, for they lessen the vigor of a
kingside attack.  Queen side attacks, by contrast,
are concerned with obtaining a passed pawn, which is
even more advantageous in the end game then the 
middle game.}
17. Bxe7 {Black was threatening to win a piece with
f6} 17...Rxe7
18. Bxe4 {White is not happy to give up his King
Bishop, but there is no way to drive away Black's
Knight at e4, and as long as it remains there it is 
more effective than the Bishop, whose diagonal itblocks.} 
 18...dxe4
19. Qg3 {Black is not the only one who has gained
something from these exchanges. Now that Black's
Queen Bishop Pawn no longer has the support of a
Queen Pawn, he is much less free to advance his queen
side pawns, and his attack on the queen side is thus
slowed.  White's backward King Pawn, which previously
was indirectly under  pressure by Black's King Rook,
now has shelter behind Black's Pawn at the latter
e4.} 19...f6 {This slightly weakens Black's
kingside, but it is worth it to prevent White's King
Bishop Pawn from ever advancing to f6.}
20. Ng4 {Threatening 21. Nxf6+.} 20...Kh8
21. f5 {Cramping Black's kingside and vacating his f4
which can now be occupied by a Rook or a Knight.} 
21...Qd7
22. Rf1 {See note at move 11.} 22...Rd8 {Preparing
Qd6 to defend his f6 pawn a second time.}
23. Rf4 {White is embarking upon a plan to attack
Black's isolated King Pawn , and tie up Black's
pieces to its defense.} 23...Qd6
24. Qh4 Rde8
25. Nc3 Bd5 {To be able to guard the King Pawn again
by Qc6.}
26. Nf2 Qc6
27. Rf1 {White must be careful now about removing any
pieces from the queen side, for Black can play b4,
followed by Qa4, menacing White's queen side pawns.}
 27...b4
28. Ne2 Qa4 ({If Black tries to advance his c Pawn with} 28..c3 {there follows} 29. bxc3, bxc3 30. Nd1, c2 31. Ndc3, Bc4 32. d5, Bxd5 33. Rc1

 defenseless against 37. Rh5 and Qh8} )
31. Nc1 {Guarding his Queen Rook Pawn. If he had done
this on move 
 twenty-nine, Black would have had the crushing reply
Qc7.} 31...c3 
 {Black gets a passed Pawn.}
32. b3 Qc6  {Both sides now have clear cut plans. 
Black will advance his 
 Queen Rook Pawn to a4, exchange pawns and bring a
Rook to a3  winning White's Queen Knight Pawn. White
will counter by advancing his King Knight Pawn to g5
and opening up his King Knight file.}
33. h3 {Making room for the Knight at h2.} 33...a5

White has a
 stroke of genius prepared.} 34...a4

of black's pinned Knight, Followed by 40. Ne5, when the Knight will be devastatingly 
 powerful.} )
38. Ng4 Bb3  ({At this moment neither Tarasch nor the
onlookers had any doubt that white was finished. In
the February 1971 issue of Chess Review, Frank
Rhoden relates that Mr. E.G. Taylor, a Hastings chess
 club member who actually witnessed the game, told him
that after Tarasch made his 38th move, "The
spectators began to drift away, thinking there was
nothing more to see." But now comes one of the most
dramatic surprises ever seen on a chessboard. With
hindsight, several annotators have advocated that
black play 38.. Rxb3, which sacrifices the exchange
for a pawn. Black would then have his Bishop 
available for the defense and obtain two dangerous
connected passed pawns. But 38...Rxb3 is no better
than the move played.}

6... c6? {Black plans to
place his Queen on Qf6, so that after White plays Qxf3
he cannot at once follow this with Qxf4 because Black
will exchange queens. With the text move Black keeps
White's knight out of Nd5 where he may eventually
harass Black's Queen. However,  if 6..

continuing in this way; Nc5 Ne6 (The knight will be
loose on c5 after Black plays d5.) Ne7 and finally

knight can recapture.}
7. Nxd4 {Regaining the pawn.}
7.. 0-0 {Continuing his developement. 7..Nxe5?? would
lose a piece after 8. Re1, f5 9. f3.}
8. Nf5 {To exchange this knight for Black's king
bishop, which would give White the two bishops and
leave Black slightly vulnerable on the dark squares.}
8.. d5 {This developing move protects his knight on
e5, and opens the diagonal of his queen bishop, which
now threatens White's knight.}
9. Bxc6 {The move that had usually been played here
was 9. Nxe7+, and this is probably best. After the
following exchanges, a position arises in which Black
has an advantage in developement, and also pressure
against White's king pawn. The situation is by no
means one sided, however; Black has some
vulnerability on the dark squares and his broken up
pawns on the queen side are weak.}
9.. bxc6 
10. Nxe7+ Qxe7
11. Re1 {This move which indirectly protects the king
pawn, is forced.  If 11. Bf4?, f6 12. f6, Rxf6 and
White already behind in developement, must lose more
time. If f3??, Qc5+ 12. Kh1, Nf2+ wins the exchange.
 If Black now plays 11. Qxe5??, 12. f3 wins a piece.}
11.. Qh4 {This move is sometimes used as an example of
Lasker's well known skill in applying the
psychological element to chess. The objectively best
move here is 11..f6, which would open the king bishop 
file and allow Black to make use of his more active
pieces. However, Lasker feels that for this
particular opponent it will be psychologically more
difficult if he plays more aggressively and goes over
to the attack. The reason? Marshall was a player
who always strove for the initiative, and he was one
of the greatest attacking and combinative players of
all time. The defense was an uncomfortable and
unfamiliar role for him.}
12. Be3 {Guarding his threatened f2.  If 12. f3 at
once was probably also good.}
12.. f6
13. f3 {To drive the knight away from the attack.}
13.. fxe5 $5 {An elegant and most surprising sacrifice.}

Qf1+ 18.Rxf1, Rxf1#)
( 15. Bd2, Bg4 16. Qc1, Rf2 
{and there is no defense to the threat of Rxg2+,
Kxg2, Bh3+, Kh1, Qf2 or Kg3, Qg4+ and mate next 
move!})
({-White should have played} 15. Qe2 dxe3 16.
Qxe3 { Black's pieces would still be more active, but
the position has been considerably simplified and
Black's horrible pawn position probably gives White a
 slight edge.})
15.. Qf6 
16. Bxd4 
(16. Bc1, Qf2+ 17. Kh1, Bg4 {wins the
exchange, for the threat of Bf3# forces White to
play} 18. Qxg4, Qxe1+)

 17. Kh1 Bh3 18. Rg1 h5 $3 {The threat is now Bg4
followed by Bf3+ and mate next move} 19. Na3 $1 (19. Qxh5
Qxg1+ 20. Kxg1 Rf1# {a very pretty variation!})
 {But
is this the end of the story? Some annotators, 
including Richard Reti in his famous book Masters of
the Chessboard, have thought so, but this is not the
case. Let this be a lesson; take no opinion as
gospel, even if it is expressed by a well known
Grandmaster!  Tarasch carries out the above analysis
a move further; White has 19. Na3! Then after}
19..Bg4 20. Rf1 Bxd1 21. Rxf2 Rxf2 22. Rxd1

pieces, and the game would probably be a draw!})

17. Rf1 {Black's attack is to strong for White to
avoid simplification.}
17.. Qxf1+
18. Qxf1 Rxf1+
19. Kxf1 {Black appears to have only a shade of
advantage in this ending.  His bishop is better than
White's knight and his pieces will come into action
faster than White's. But as usual, his weak queenside
pawns affect the picture. Once White plays his
knight to b3, they will be under considerable
pressure. Now, however, Lasker with an almost 
magical charm finds away to obtain a decisive
advantage.}
19.. Rb8 $1 {Instead of giving a bishop check on a6 or
h3, Black plays this surprising but far stronger
move. By forcing White's reply, Black denies White's
knight the crucial b3 square.}
20. b3 Rb5 $3 {Still leaving his bishop at home,
Black moves his rook to an active position on the
fourth rank.  To his frustration, White now finds
that he can not develop his knight. If 21. Nd2, Rh5 
22. Kg1 Rc5  23. Rc1.  (If 23. Nc4, Bh3. ) 
23..Ba6 threatening Bd3, and White is helpless. To
avoid this, White is forced to advance his bishop pawn
to the forth rank, which will give Black a passed
queen pawn.}
21. c4 Rh5 {Forces White to take a move to protect
his queen rook pawn, thereby giving White no time to
play b4 to stop Black from playing c5.}
22. Kg1 c5 {Now it is a protected passed pawn.}
23. Nd2 Kf7 {If Black delayed developing his king,
White would play 24. Rf1 and temporarily keep it out
of the game.}
24. Rf1+? {Whites only chance was 24. a3, attempting 
25. b4 to eliminate the protector of Black's passed
pawn.}
24.. Ke7
25. a3 {To late!}
25.. Rh6 {The fourth rank now occupied by his bishop
pawn, Black places his rook on the third rank, which
by reason of the removal of this same pawn is now the
most active rank.}
26. h4 {So that his king will not be tied down to the
defense of this pawn. If 26. b4, Ra6 when 27. Ra1
can be answered by 27..b4 and White's rook pawn is
pinned.}
26.. Ra6 {Forcing White either to tie his rook down to
this pawn's  defence, or play a4 and renounce the
possibility of b4 forever.}
27. Ra1 Bg4 {Finally developing the bishop.}
28. Kf2 Ke6 {Bringing his king forward to help his
passed pawn.}
29. a4 {There is nothing better. If 29. Nf3 to
prevent Black's king from reaching e5, then 29..Bxf3 
30. Kxf3 Ke5 followed by Rf6+ wins the king pawn. 
White, of course can not play Re1 without losing his 
queen rook pawn.}
29.. Ke5
30. Kg2 Rf6 {Now that he need not worry about b4 by
White, Black  brings his rook to the open file.}
31.  Re1 d3 {With the Black king so close for
protection, this pawn can safely advance.}
32. Rf1 Kd4 {If now 33. Nf3+, Bxf3+ {{Not 33.. 
Kxe4??, 34. Re1+, Kf5 35. Re5+, Kg6 36. Rg5+ and
White wins the bishop! (Or 33.. Ke3?? 34. Re1#!) 
34. Rxf3 d2 {and this pawn can not be stopped from
queening.}
33. Rxf6 gxf6
34. Kf2 {At the moment, Whites K pawn is protected by
his knight, and his king keeps Black's king from
invading. But one of these pieces has no move! 
Black's next two moves mark time, so that White
exhausts his reserve of pawn moves.}
